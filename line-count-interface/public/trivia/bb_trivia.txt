A higher episode count serves as the tie-breaker.
For characters with identical names, I've added the first episodein which they appeared in parentheses.
Walt, Skyler, and Jesse were in all 62 episodes. Following them are: Hank and Junior (53), Marie (51), Saul (36), Gomez and Holly (33), Mike (25), Gus (24), Skinny Pete (15), Ted (13), Badger (12), Todd and Huell (11), and Jane, Tyrus, Merkert, and Francesca (10).
Highest lines-per-episode averages (minimum 3 episodes): Walt (62.0), Jesse (34.9), Skyler (26.5), Hank (23.5), Elliott (22.3), Tuco (20.5), Gretchen (19.8), Jane (19.2), Lydia (18.2), Mike (18.0), Krazy-8 (17.3), Donald Margolis (15.5), Badger (15.1), Ted (14.5), Tim Roberts (13.8).
The lines-per-episode averages of the other main characters (and Gomez): Marie (13.1), Saul (12.9), Gus (11.5), Todd (10.3), Junior (10.1), Gomez (8.4).
Characters in 5+ episodes with the lowest lines-per-episode averages: Holly (0.03), Matt (0.8), Lester (1.2), Frankie (1.3), Leonel (1.5), Hector (1.8), Marco (1.8), Kaylee (2.0), Brock (2.4), Tyrus (2.5), Francesca (2.5), Victor (2.6), Huell (3.0), Carmen (4.6), Kenny (5.6).
Most lines in an episode: 117 by Walt in “4 Days Out”. Other times a character said 100+ lines in an episode: 109 by Jesse in “Fly”, 106 by Walt in “A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal” and in “Fly”, 105 by Jesse in “4 Days Out”, and 101 by Walt in “Pilot”.
Skyler’s highest total was 71 in “Open House” (she tied with Walt for most in the episode). Hank’s highest was 60 in “Bit by a Dead Bee”. Mike’s highest was also 60 in “Madrigal”. Saul’s highest was 50 in “Better Call Saul” (as a guest star). Marie’s highest was 49 in “Open House”. Gus’s highest was 48 in “Hermanos”. Lydia’s highest was 49 in “Dead Freight” (as a guest star). Junior’s highest was 30 in “Ozymandias”. Todd’s highest was also 30 in “Granite State”. Gomez’s highest was 27 in “To'hajiilee”.
Walt’s lowest total was 20 in “Box Cutter”. Skyler’s lowest total was 1 in “Fly” and “Madrigal” (her line in “Fly” was voiceover). Jesse’s lowest total was 0 in “Buried”. 
Walt had the most lines in 46 of the 62 episodes. Jesse was first 7 times, Skyler was first 6 times, Hank twice, and Gus and Mike each once. Jesse was second place most often with 20 instances, followed by Hank with 13. Jesse was also the most common character in third place with 15 instances, followed by Skyler with 13. 
The longest streak of first place finishes was by Walt going 8 episodes from S1E1 “Pilot” to S2E1 “Seven Thirty-Seven”. Walt finished first in every episode of Season 1.
Walt was first in 46 out of 62 episodes. The times he was defeated: “Grilled” (Hank, then Jesse), “Bit by a Dead Bee” (Hank, then Jesse), “Breakage” (Jesse), “Peekaboo” (Jesse), “Over” (Jesse), “I.F.T.” (Skyler), “Más” (Jesse), “Kafkaesque” (Skyler, then Marie, then Jesse), “Fly” (Jesse), “Abiquiu” (Jesse), “Box Cutter” (Skyler), “Hermanos” (Gus), “Salud” (Skyler, then Junior, then Ted), “End Times” (Jesse), “Madrigal” (Mike), “Buried” (Skyler, then Hank).
The seasons in which Walt was defeated for first place the most were seasons 2 and 3, 5 times in each season.
Todd scored the lowest of any main character. Gomez scored the highest of any guest character. Dr. Delcavoli scored the highest of any character whose actor was never listed in the opening credits.
Krazy-8 was the highest-scoring character that appeared in only one season (52 in S1). Donald Margolis was the highest-scoring character that spoke in only one season (62 in S2). 
Ed was the highest-scoring character that appeared in only one episode (36 in S5E15 “Granite State”). Spooge was the highest-scoring character that spoke in only one episode (38 in S2E6 “Peekaboo”).
Mike’s Season 5A count propelled him past Gus (after S5E2 “Madrigal”), Saul (S5E5 “Dead Freight”), and Junior (S5E7 “Say My Name”). He held on to his sixth place standing for two episodes before Junior took it back (S5E9 “Blood Money”). It took Saul until his final appearance to reclaim seventh overall (S5E15 “Granite State”).
Marie and Junior were jockeying for fourth place for 27 episodes, until Marie took fifth place overall in the series after S3E8 “I See You” and never let it up.
Jesse was third in the first episode, but passed Skyler for second by the next episode. Besides this, the final order of the top 4 (Walt, Jesse, Skyler, Hank) held true for the duration of the series.
Walt is first in every season. Counting Season 5 overall, Jesse is the only other character always in the top 3. Skyler and Hank are always in the top 5. Marie and Junior are always in the top 10. Starting in Season 2 (when he first appears), Saul is always in the top 10. 
Badger and Ted are the only guest characters to appear in the top 10 of a season twice; Badger did it in S1 and S2, and Ted did it in S2 and S4. If you count Season 5A and 5B as separate, then Gomez did as well, in S3 and S5A.
The only guest characters to appear in all 5 seasons are Gomez, Badger, and Skinny Pete (they all appeared in both halves of Season 5 as well).
Mike was introduced in Season 2, but more than half of his lines came in Season 5A.
The closest anyone ever got to Walt’s first place was Jesse in Season 2 (only 204 lines behind over a 13-episode season). The widest margin of victory for Walt was Season 5A, where he beat Mike by 300 lines.
Each main character’s most prominent season (by average): S1 for Walt, Skyler; S2 for Jesse, Saul; S4 for Gus; S5A for Hank, Marie, Mike, Lydia; S5B for Junior, Todd
Each main character’s least prominent season (by average): S2 for Marie; S3 for Hank, Junior, Gus; S4 for Walt, Mike (only in one episode in S2); S5A for Skyler, Saul, Todd; S5B for Jesse, Lydia
Notable characters’ most prominent season (by total): S1 for Carmen; S2 for Walt, Jesse, Hank, Junior, Jane, Badger, Skinny Pete, Gretchen, Tuco, Mrs. Pinkman, Combo; S3 for Marie, Saul, Gomez, Andrea, Gale, Merkert, Group Leader, Mr. Pinkman, Bolsa, Victor; S4 for Skyler, Gus, Ted, Tim Roberts, Kuby, Bogdan, Francesca, Brock; S5A for Mike, Lydia, Declan, Ramey; S5B for Todd, Jack, Elliott, Kenny, Huell.
Each main character’s (and Gomez’s) least prominent season (by total): S1 for Hank, Marie (tie), Gomez; S2 for Marie (tie), Gus, Mike; S5A for Skyler, Junior, Saul, Todd; S5B for Walt, Jesse, Lydia
Marie finished the series with exactly as many lines as Jesse had in Season 2 alone.
Marie finished with the same number of lines (85) in Season 1 and Season 2 despite there being 6 more episodes in Season 2.
Junior’s highest-scoring season total was 120 for Season 2. This matched Skyler’s and Jesse’s lowest-scoring season total for Season 5A and 5B respectively. This was also the only time that Junior scored 100+ lines in a season (if you count Season 5 overall, he had 145).
Jane had 175 lines in Season 2. This is more lines than Marie, Junior, Saul, Gus, Lydia, or Todd ever had in a season (Marie had more if you count Season 5 as a whole). The only other time a guest had 100+ lines in a season was Lydia in Season 5A when she had 109.
The most lines by a guest character in an episode was 59 by Jane in S2E12 “Phoenix”. She was second in the episode behind Walt with 86. This was more lines in a single episode than Marie, Junior, Saul, Gus, Lydia, or Todd ever had. Saul had 50 lines in his introductory episode S2E8 “Better Call Saul”, and these are the only two instances of a guest character having 50+ lines in a single episode.
Season 5 as a whole had 3 more episodes than Seasons 2 through 4. However, it was not the season with the highest line total for Skyler or Jesse. Skyler’s S5 total (321) was less than her totals for S2 and S4 (373 and 402). Jesse’s S5 total (355) was less than his totals for S2, S3, and S4 (666, 429, and 384). Jesse had only 27 fewer lines in S1 which had 9 fewer episodes.
Badger surpassed Jane for total lines after El Camino.
Jane’s record of 59 lines in a single episode by a guest character still holds after El Camino. Neil tied her with 59 lines.
With Ed’s second appearance in El Camino, Detective Getz becomes the highest-scoring character to only appear in one episode. He had 30 lines in S2E8 “Better Call Saul”.
After El Camino, Badger joins Gomez as the only guest characters with 200+ lines. Skinny Pete joins Gomez, Badger, Jane, and Ted as the only guest characters with 150+ lines.
Walt, Jesse, Badger, and Skinny Pete become the only characters to appear in every season of Breaking Bad and El Camino.
